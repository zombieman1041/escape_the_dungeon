About 60% pair programming; Blake created initial structures for the game skeleton and the music settings; Ben designed the data structure for the relaying stats came up with the way to pass files; M'Kya created dynamic elements in CSS and developed story structure. 

### Challenges ###

Our initial challenges involved deciding on an engine for developing the game, we began working with a game engine that specialized in web games but could not get it to work, we tried another game engine but finally settled on just having our code in files.
We ran into some problems with finding errors. Because JS allows for so much there were times when our code would not throw any errors at all even when it was not working properly.
Another challenge we faced was learning the syntax and formating, we were slowed down by having to look up many things.

### What we learned ###
The power of JavaScript! Neater code is better code. Javascript variables can be anything- an example is our variable for the stats. 
Semicolons are optional. Even though JS can be hard to read it is very powerful and that is great.
