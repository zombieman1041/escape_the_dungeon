                        combat, but can only recall vague memories of the night before. As the expected questions arise: 
                        where am I, who are you, how did we get here, and memories return, they piece together their 
                        circumstance. They learn that they are each members of a secret resistance against the throne ...
                        enemies of the king... and soon realize that their party of three must be the sole survivors of the 
                        failed and final attempt to seize the throne from the Tyrant king, by the resistance. The abnormally 
                        agile Rat, the stunningly strong Usurper, and the insidiously intelligent Deceiver, quickly 
                        understand that they must work together if they wish to escape before their execution. </p>
